# FlagSync SDK for Node.js

At [FlagSync](https://www.flagsync.com), we believe the power of feature flags and A/B testing should be accessible to everyone, regardless of business size or budget.

That's why we developed an affordable, user-friendly platform that delivers the core functionality needed by indie hackers and growing businesses, without unnecessary complexity. [Get started](https://docs.flagsync.com/getting-started/set-up-flagsync) using FlagSync today!
